  <p>In a talk that's by turns heartbreaking and hilarious, writer and podcaster Nora McInerny shares her hard-<br>earned wisdom about life and death. Her candid approach to something that will, let's face it, affect us all,<br> is as liberating as it is gut-wrenching. Most powerfully, she encourages us to shift how we approach grief. <br>"A grieving person is going to laugh again and smile again," she says. "They're going to move forward. <br>But that doesn't mean that they've moved on."</p>
